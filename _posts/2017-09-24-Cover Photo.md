Thank you to the editorial team at the Journal of [Restoration Ecology](http://bit.ly/2HCmJx6), a Journal of the [Society for Ecological Restoration](http://www.ser.org/) for choosing my submitted photo to be on the cover of the [September 2017](http://bit.ly/2sJH00p) issue!

This photo was taken during the controlled fire treatments we applied to our [bluegrass restoration study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rec.12491/full) in Central Queensland, Australia in 2011 when I was apart of the [Mayfield Ecology Lab](http://www.mayfieldplantecologylab.org/) at the University of Queensland in Brisbane ...:

This is an important milestone for me because it is my first photo publsihed in a scientific journal. I am an amateur photographer, aspiring to  use photography as a tool to educate and inspire people on conservation issues. I would like to build a portfolio of published photos and one day apply to be a Fellow in the [International League of Conservation Photographers](https://conservationphotographers.org/).
