## Initiating Synthesis in Restoration Ecology
{: style="text-align: center;"}
The recently declared [‘Decade on Ecological Restoration’](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/new-un-decade-ecosystem-restoration-offers-unparalleled-opportunity) by the United Nations represents a timely opportunity to develop a strong and integrative path forward for ecological restoration. 


This project aims to bring together restoration researchers globally to pool existing data and knowledge for a deeper understanding of restoration science.

Restoration has been taking place for decades across ecosystems, in every part of the world, with millions being spent. Different types of restoration ‘action’ have been taking place, depending on the definitions and targets of individual projects and their context. Data collected are used for monitoring, the results of which are sometimes published in academic journals, sometimes not. Projects and investment will continue, the results of which will affect legacies for decades more.

The [Global Restore Project (GRP)](https://www.globalrestoreproject.com) will develop a large, cross-cutting and collaborative effort to compile data from across the world, across ecosystems and across restoration efforts and types. The Global Arid Zone Project (GAZP) is a collaborative subset and drylands network of the Global Restore Project. Please visit the [GRP](https://www.globalrestoreproject.com) and [GAZP](https://drylandrestore.com) project websites for more information!

## Focus
We are interested in ecological **community data**, and will begin by focusing on grasslands, drylands and wetlands. Below are examples of the ecosystems, habitats, degradation and restoration types we are interested in. As opposed to a traditional meta-analysis, which uses effect-sizes for analyses, and is thus an analysis of analyses, we are interested in building a database of raw data, allowing more flexibility and power for syntheses to take place to maximise the learning potential of this endeavor. 


**We are also interested in cost data in the smallest units recorded.**
{: .notice--danger}

| Ecosystem Type | Restoration Type | Habitat | Example | Taxa | Measure | Cost |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| Marine | Active | Mangroves | Planting | Plants & Fish | Richness & Abundance | per tree |
| Marine | Passive | Salt Marsh | Removal of effluent pipe | Invertebrates | Richness & Abundance | cost of removal |
|----
| Freshwater | Active | Wetland | Returning hydrological flow & Planting | Plants | Richness & Abundance | total cost |
| Freshwater | Passive | Bog | Cessation of peat removal | Plants | Richness & Abundance | purchase of land |
|----
| Terrestrial | Active | Drylands | Seeding | Plants | Richness & Cover | per m sq |
|=====
| Terrestrial | Passive | Grasslands | Removal of Agricultural Practices | Plants & Insects | Richness & Biomass | any associated costs |
