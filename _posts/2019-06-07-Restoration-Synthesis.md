## Knowledge sharing for shared success
{: style="text-align: center;"}
The recently declared [‘Decade on Ecological Restoration’](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/new-un-decade-ecosystem-restoration-offers-unparalleled-opportunity) by the United Nations represents a timely opportunity to develop a strong and integrative path forward for ecological restoration. 


The [Global Restore Project (GRP)](https://www.globalrestoreproject.com) aims to bring together restoration researchers globally to pool existing data and knowledge for a deeper understanding of restoration science.

Restoration has been taking place for decades across ecosystems, in every part of the world, with millions being spent. Different types of restoration ‘action’ have been taking place, depending on the definitions and targets of individual projects and their context. Data collected are used for monitoring, the results of which are sometimes published in academic journals, sometimes not. Projects and investment will continue, the results of which will affect legacies for decades more.

Together, we will develop a large, cross-cutting and collaborative effort to compile data from across the world, across ecosystems and across restoration efforts and types, and build a global network of restoration practitioners and projects. The Global Arid Zone Project (GAZP) Database is a collaborative drylands subset and network of the Global Restore Project. Please visit the [GRP](https://www.globalrestoreproject.com) and [GAZP](https://drylandrestore.com) project websites for more information!

## Focus
We are interested in ecological **community data**, and will begin by focusing on grasslands, drylands and wetlands. We are interested in building a database of raw data, allowing more flexibility and power for syntheses to take place to maximise the learning potential of this endeavor. We are advocating for restoration [knowledge sharing](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2688-8319.12117) and for [collaborative synthesis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rec.13251) in restoration for shared success to support restoration efforts.
