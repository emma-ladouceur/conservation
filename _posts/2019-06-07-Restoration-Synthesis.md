## Initiating Synthesis in Restoration Ecology
The recently declared [‘Decade on Ecological Restoration’](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/new-un-decade-ecosystem-restoration-offers-unparalleled-opportunity) by the United Nations represents a timely opportunity to develop a strong and integrative path forward for ecological restoration. One of the most effective ways to do this is to create a living data repository where restoration successes (and failures) are collated and made freely available to researchers and practitioners alike. 
{: .notice--success}

## Why
Ecological restoration has been taking place for decades across ecosystems, in every part of the world, with millions being spent. Different types of restoration ‘action’ have been taking place, depending on the definitions and targets of individual projects and their context. Data collected are used for monitoring, the results of which are sometimes published in academic journals, sometimes not. Projects and investment will continue, the results of which will affect habitat legacies as a complementary conservation action for decades more. 
{: .notice--danger}

## What
We are in the process of developing a large, cross-cutting and collaborative effort to compile data from across the world, across ecosystems and across restoration efforts and types. We plan to publish an open-access data paper, maintain and grow the database as other efforts join, and lead the syntheses of these data in order to move forward into this dawning decade with an idea of what works and doesn’t, what constitutes success, and major lessons learned.

## Team
Please see our core team [here](https://emma-ladouceur.github.io/conservation/projects/Restoration-Synthesis/team/). Project organiser, [Emma Ladouceur](https://www.idiv.de/groups_and_people/employees/details/eshow/ladouceur_emma.html) is a postdoc with the [Biodiversity Synthesis](https://www.idiv.de/groups_and_people/core_groups/synthesis/people.html) & [Physiological Diversity](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=38876) groups at The German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) in Leipzig, Germany. She is supported by [iDiv](https://www.idiv.de/), Martin Luther University & The Hemholtz Centre for Environmental Research [(UFZ)](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=45949). She will initiate this work with the support of iDiv and continue this work with the support of the [Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html) and iDiv as a postdoctoral fellow.

## Focus
We are interested in ecological **community data**, and will begin by focusing on grasslands, drylands and wetlands. Below are examples of the ecosystems, habitats, degradation and restoration types we are interested in. As opposed to a traditional meta-analysis, which uses effect-sizes for analyses, and is thus an analysis of analyses, we are interested in building a database of raw data, allowing more flexibility and power for syntheses to take place to maximise the learning potential of this endeavor. 
{: .notice--primary}

**We are also interested in cost data in the smallest units recorded.**
{: .notice--danger}

| Ecosystem Type | Restoration Type | Habitat | Example | Taxa | Measure | Cost |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| Marine | Active | Mangroves | Planting | Plants & Fish | Richness & Abundance | per tree |
| Marine | Passive | Salt Marsh | Removal of effluent pipe | Invertebrates | Richness & Abundance | cost of removal |
|----
| Freshwater | Active | Wetland | Returning hydrological flow & Planting | Plants | Richness & Abundance | total cost |
| Freshwater | Passive | Bog | Cessation of peat removal | Plants | Richness & Abundance | purchase of land |
|----
| Terrestrial | Active | Drylands | Seeding | Plants | Richness & Cover | per m sq |
|=====
| Terrestrial | Passive | Grasslands | Removal of Agricultural Practices | Plants & Insects | Richness & Biomass | any associated costs |

## Planned Work
Initially, we will focus data collection efforts on ecological communities in the systems and restoration types listed above with a particular interest in grasslands where seeding treatments have been applied. However we are also interested in other treatment types and passive restoration. We would ideally like to to have community data, and compare **restored** sites to **degraded** and **pristine/healthy reference sites** in terms of their; **diversity, structure, and ecosystem function**. For this, at a minimum, we require site by species matrices. Multiple measurements across time are fantatstic, but not a requirement. We are also interested in structural functional traits of plants, as well as funtional plant traits related to different types of ecosystem function (eg. pollination syndrome = pollination services), and species trophic interaction data (eg. insects, birds).
{: .notice--warning} 

## Future
Additionally, we are collecting data beyond those mentioned above for further future syntheses, as we come across it in our search. We would like to collect raw data from marine, terrestrial, & freshwater environments that have undergone different forms of active or passive restoration. This includes rewilding. Some examples are given in the table below. Please get in touch for more details, discussion and with any further questions! **If you are planning syntheses in one of these systems, we would love to hear from you to chat about your plans.**

| Marine | Active | Coral Reef | Artificial Reef | Coral | Richness & Cover | cost of reef structure |
| Marine | Passive | Seagrass Meadows | Planting | Fish & Plants | Abundance & Cover | cost of planting |

| Freshwater | Active | Lake | Toxic algae removal | Algae | Abundance | removal cost |
| Freshwater | Passive | River | Dam removal| Fish | Richness & Abundance | total cost |

| Terrestrial | Active | Forests | Planting | Plants | Richness & Cover | per plant |

| Terrestrial | Passive | Tundra | Removal of disturbance | Plants | Richness & Cover | any associated costs |

## Data Paper
A [data paper](https://www.nature.com/sdata/) is planned which will include all data custodians and original authors who choose to opt-in.
{: .notice--success}

## Get Involved
 We invite **anyone** (individuals, organisations, institutions) involved in restoration, in any corner of the world to participate in this open-access endeavour to synthesize the future of restoration.
 **You can:** 

 * suggest projects to investigate;
 * put us in contact with colleagues, aquaintances or projects;
 * point us to data sources;
 * donate your very own  data;

 ...to be a part of an effort to quantify success and synthesize the future of ecological restoration.

## Current Status 
This work has started in **May 2019**. Initial data collection will continue until May 2021...and is intended to be an open access, living, growing database and resource for the restoration community.
{: .notice--danger}

## Data Management
![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/idiv_banner2.png){: .align-center}
Data will be managed by [Emma Ladouceur](https://www.idiv.de/groups_and_people/employees/details/eshow/ladouceur_emma.html), and through various support mechanisms at iDiv, data will be archived in an open access public repository attached to the data paper.
