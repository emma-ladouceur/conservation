I feel very fortunate to be starting a Postdoctoral Fellowship with the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity aka [iDiv](https://www.idiv.de/), in Leipzig, Germany today! It's strange because I am not physically there, I am away taking a Structural Equation Modelling course. But a symbolic day for me nonetheless, so a few notes from the road. What's in a title? Does the mental transition from PhD student to postdoc happen instantly, or will it take time? I wonder if Alice in Wonderland has some cookies for that. Either way, I'm excited.

I am joining Jonathan Chase's [Biodiversity Synthesis](https://www.idiv.de/groups_and_people/core_groups/synthesis.html) Group, & Stan Harpole's [Physiological Diversity](https://www.idiv.de/groups_and_people/core_groups/physiological_diversity.html) Group to look at the mechanisms of Community Assembly on Ecosystem Function- newly dubbed, the [CAFE](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.12895) approach by a previous iDiv- [sDiv](https://www.idiv.de/sdiv.html) working group.

Reflecting on my experience applying for postdoc positions as a fresh PhD graduate, I applied for five advertised postdoc positions, and three  positions outside of academia for other roles. I started applying 6 months before the end of my PhD. I should have started sooner. I was invited for interviews for two of the five postdoc positions, and was successful in one. I think the average success rate is lower than that. I started this position 7 months after my PhD contract finished. I applied Internationally across seven different countries, and two continents. I targeted my applications to only apply for advertised positions which were completely or mostly related to my current interests and the trajectory I would like to take in my career. I explored  approximately six other funding schemes and university programs to fund postdoctoral research. If not successful in this position, I would have proceeded to write project proposals for various funding schemes at institutes of interest. With both my PhD position and my succesfull postdoc application there was definitely a major element of 'right place, right time', but also alot of hard work and personal sacrifice to get all the right elements in place to put myself in that 'right place' in a timely manner.

I think an important next step for me will to write some proposals to get some of my own funding, and I already have some organisations and opportunities flagged that I will give it a first try with.

Now: onto the transition!
