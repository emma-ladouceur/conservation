## seedr: Hydro and Thermal Time Seed Germination Models in R
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Based on some work i did during my PhD, [Eduardo Fernández-Pascual](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4743-9577) and [Gil González-Rodríguez](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2532-8665), led the charge to turn this work into an R package and get it up on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seedr/index.html). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/efernandezpascual/seedr).

**seedr** enables analysis of seed germination data using the physiological time modelling approach. The package includes functions to fit hydrotime and thermal-time models with the traditional approaches of [Bradford (1990)](doi:10.1104/pp.94.2.840) and [Garcia-Huidobro (1982)](doi:10.1093/jxb/33.2.288). Allows to fit models to grouped datasets, i.e. datasets containing multiple species, seedlots or experiments.


We are looking for testers and feedback so if you have a germination dataset and you'd like to give it a try drop us a note!
