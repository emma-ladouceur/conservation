[Dynamic Ecology](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/ "Dynamic Ecology") is my favorite blog introduced to me by one of my mentors (post on the importance of mentors coming soon) that has been around for quite awhile. This blog continues to provide us with lots of things to smile about;

Dynamic Ecology wrote a very popular piece, [Books that all ecology grad students should read](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2015/02/02/books-that-all-ecology-grad-students-should-read/ "Books that all ecology grad student should read") in 2015, and i was very drawn to it for inspiration and advice. There were many comments on that post inspiring contributions and discussion, but was hard to follow the layered discussion in the comment feed and i found myself revisiting the page often to search for book titles. So, I compiled the list from the post and most comments i found relevant, and have found myself sharing this list with several colleagues. While many of these were debated on the grounds of the value, the niche relevance or the grains of salt that must be taken while reading them, I compile them without comment or filtering here.

Dynamic Ecology has also written very interesting posts on [Favorite Ecology Textbooks ](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/whats-your-favorite-ecology-textbook/ "Favorite Ecology Textbooks") and [A New Ecology Textbook Needed](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/07/15/new-ecology-textbook-needed/ "A New Ecology Textbook: Needed") which I might try to compile the comments of at some point.

> Note: I have not necesarily read all of these books, but i intend to try over the years. In addition, these books do not represent my views or opinions, nor do i necesarily endorse them.
