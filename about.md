## This Site
Welcome to my personal research website. I'll be using this site for sharing updates on my career, research articles, R code, MARXAN, and blog posts. I taught myself to build this page with help from the [Algonquin College Desgin School You Tube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/acinteractivedesign/videos), [Github pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/), and from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). 


## Research, Background & Reviewer Statment
I am a vegetation and seed ecologist interested in applied practical research, systematic decision making, and solutions to solve the most pressing issues in conservation biology and restoration ecology.

I am formally trained in planning (urban & environmental), environmental management and conservation biology. I am able to peer review research articles surrounding any of these topics. Please see my Publications & CV in the navigation menu above for more details.
