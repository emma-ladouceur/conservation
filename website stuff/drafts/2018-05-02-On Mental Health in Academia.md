The alternative title for the post is *how did you survive*? Newsflash! PhD students face significant mental health [challenges](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/04/phd-students-face-significant-mental-health-challenges), they require more mental health [support](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/03/graduate-students-need-more-mental-health-support-new-study-highlights), and many feel its time to talk about [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04023-5), and the [crisis](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/03/graduate-students-need-more-mental-health-support-new-study-highlights) involved.

I could not agree more. While PhD students were those involved in these studies and reports, I argue that the mental health struggle doesn't stop there. Post Doctoral Fellows face similar challenges. Afterall, there are a growing number of post doc's and few places in academia for them to [go](https://www.nature.com/news/the-future-of-the-postdoc-1.17253), and many feel new types of academic positions are [needed](https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110302/full/471007a.html).  Post doc's come at a hefty [price](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/01/price-doing-postdoc) personally, and the human pressures of doing a post doc are [intense](https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/aug/10/the-human-cost-of-the-pressures-of-postdoctoral-research). These prospects also contribute to PhD student health, and in fact, probably the entire array of academic staff could use mental health support.

A mentor of mine planted the seed in my head a long time ago by saying, *"PhD's are isolating experiences"*. I looked around and saw many of my colleagues suffering in different ways. I also heard someone once say to make sure to have another hobby or pasttime that gives you focus, joy and sense of accomplishment, so that when the PhD isn't going well, you can step away and do something to give you the opposite feeling. I decided to take a pro-active approach to my mental health during my PhD, almost prescribed in a way, to fill my life with things that are supposed to make me feel better in low times, until i did feel better. 

For me, my joyful pastimes included [ashtanga yoga](https://youtu.be/aUgtMaAZzW0), long distance cycling and hiking.

Another preventative aspect was a commitment to a healthy diet, and prioritized sleep patterns. Lastly, I found what time I was most productive, and blocked those periods off from doing anything else, but my toughest PhD related tasks.


And in short, this is how I survived and succeeded, but I still struggled with my mental health in a way I never had before. I now am seeing a personal coach to take a proactive approach to my current challenges, and am speaking with my new institution about what a world renound academic staff mental health support program might look like.
