This week I participated in the [Skype a Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/) program! It was such a great experience. I was paired with a school in Atlanta who's fourth grade classes were reading [Wish Tree](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/books/review/katherine-applegate-wishtree.html) by Katherine Applegate. They requested a plant scientist because the students had lots of questions about trees! Skype a scientist helpfully recommended to send a few short videos on the topics we would be talking about, and to ask the kids to write down questions to ask me and have them sent in advance if possible. This was a great suggestion because the kids were shy at first, so allowed me to speak to the questions they already sent me. I told them to stick up their hand if they had another question, and sure enough after i spoke for a few minutes the questions started pouring in! We had the best time! They're questions were excellent!

We didn't just talk about trees, the classes wanted to know all about being a scientist and how to become one. I cannot recommend volunteering to participate in this program enough for both teachers, and scientists! It was a learning experience for me too!
