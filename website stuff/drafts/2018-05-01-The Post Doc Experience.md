I feel very fortunte to announce I am starting a Postdoctoral Fellowship with the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity aka [iDiv](https://www.idiv.de/), in Leipzig, Germany today! I am joining Jonathan Chase's [Biodiversity Synthesis](https://www.idiv.de/groups_and_people/core_groups/synthesis.html) Group, & Stan Harpole's [Physiological Diversity](https://www.idiv.de/groups_and_people/core_groups/physiological_diversity.html) Group to look at the mechanisms of Community Assembly on Ecosystem Function- newly dubbed, the [CAFE](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.12895) approach.

Reflecting on my experience applying for post doc positions as a fresh PhD graduate, I applied for five advertised post docs positions, and three  positions outside of academia for other roles. I started applying 6 months before the end of my PhD. I was invited for interviews for two of the five post doc positions, and was successful in one. I started this position, 7 months after my PhD contract finished. I applied Internationally across seven different countries, and two continents. I targeted my applications to only apply for advertised positions which were completely or mostly related to my current interests and the trajectory I would like to take in my career. I explored  approximately six other funding schemes and university programs to fund postdoctoral research. If not successful in this position, I would have proceeded to write project proposals for various funding schemes at institutes of interest.

I think an important next step for me will to write some proposals to get some of my own funding, and I already have some organisations and opportunities flagged that I will give it a first try with.

Now: onto the transition!
