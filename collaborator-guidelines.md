## Become a Collaborator
Becoming a collaborator is open to restoration ecologists who are comitted to joining this data synthesis effort following the [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) principals, collaborating with the team, or initiating projects of their own. There are three primary rules of joining us as a collaborator:

* Play well with other members of the team;
* Donate your Data;
* Agree that your data can be shared open access as apart of our planned [data paper](https://www.nature.com/sdata/)).

## Co-Authorship Criteria
There are some initial papers planned attached to this effort. If your data is suitable for use in the first papers and is used, this will be indicated as apart of initial discussions, and you will be invited to opt-in to the paper for collaboration.

### To opt-in to co-authorship, data providers must contribute in at least two of the following four ways:
1. Idea/question generation
2. Data contribution
3. Data Analysis
4. Writing & Revisions

## Propose a Synthesis Project
If your data do not fit with the data requirements of some of the papers that are already planned, you are welcome to propose an idea of your own. We will cross-check your idea with that of others, connect you with people or projects with overlapping ideas and data, and give you assistance and guidance for getting started and in collecting more of these data.

## Data Management

Data will be managed by [Emma Ladouceur](https://www.idiv.de/groups_and_people/employees/details/eshow/ladouceur_emma.html), and through various support mechanisms at iDiv, data will be archived in an open access public repository attached to the data paper.
